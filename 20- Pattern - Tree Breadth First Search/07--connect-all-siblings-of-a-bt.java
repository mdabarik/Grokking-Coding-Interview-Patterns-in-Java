/*
The task is to connect all nodes in a binary tree. Connect them from left to right so that the next pointer of each node points to the node on its immediate right. The next pointer of the right-most node at each level should point to the first node of the next level in the tree.

Each node in the given binary tree for this problem includes a next pointer, along with the left and right pointers. Your solution must set the next pointer to connect the same level nodes to each other and across levels.

/* Do it on your own, use level or traversal technique, pretty easy job */
